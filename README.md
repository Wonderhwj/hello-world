# hello-world
This is my first repository. Let's study and have fun here!
I am currently a master student in University of Leeds, studying Business Analytics and Decision Science. 
I went to University of Minnesota, Twin-Cities for undergrad, majored in economics and minored in math and statistics. 
I like interacting with people. I had many experience working with students in undergrad. 
Right now, I want to take one more step on developing, and explore GitHub. Have some fun here and also prepare for my future career.
